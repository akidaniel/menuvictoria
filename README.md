Font Distribution Agreement.
This Font Distribution Agreement (this “Agreement”) becomes a binding contract between you (“Licensor” or “you”) and Monotype Imaging Inc., with offices located at 600 Unicorn Park Drive, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801 and its wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, ”Monotype”) when you click on the area marked “ACCEPT AGREEMENT” or similar language or you otherwise manifest assent to the terms of this Agreement or, if signatures are attached to this Agreement, on the date of the last signature (the “Effective Date”).

This Agreement contains capitalized terms that are defined in Section 11. Please refer to those defined terms when reading this Agreement and be certain that you understand such terms prior to indicating your acceptance of this Agreement.

The purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the terms on which Monotype may distribute certain font software owned by you. The relationship between you and Monotype will be managed through a Monotype Font Platform account accessible at fontplatform.monotype.com and ancillary platforms and/or services provided through the foundrysupport.monotype.com website (your “Account”). In order for Monotype to implement this Agreement, you need to provide to Monotype all of the foundry information requested in your Account. If you cannot enter the foundry information via your Account, you must provide such information to Monotype in a manner mutually agreed upon by you and Monotype.

You and Monotype hereby agree as follows:

1.    Your Obligations.

You shall deliver the Deliverables for the Licensed Font Software to Monotype through your Account within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. You may add Licensed Font Software governed by this Agreement at any time during the Term by indicating your desire to do so in your Account and providing the Deliverables for the additional Licensed Font Software to Monotype.

2.    Monotype’s Rights.

You grant Monotype a non-exclusive, world-wide, nontransferable, non-assignable license for the term herein to, directly or indirectly, through any and all methods and distribution channels (whether such methods and/or distribution channels presently exist or may exist in the future), reproduce, modify, enhance, distribute, perform, and/or display the Deliverables.
You grant Monotype a non-exclusive, world-wide license to use the Licensed Trademarks to identify the Licensed Font Software, and to authorize Monotype’s distributors and resellers to use the Licensed Trademarks to identify and promote Licensed Font Software.
Monotype shall have the royalty-free right to use the Deliverables for its own internal business use and for marketing and promotional purposes.
3.    Monotype’s Obligations.

Monotype shall require that all distributions in which the Licensed Font Software is distributed as a standalone product or in a manner in which extraction is permitted shall be made pursuant to an End User License Agreement.
Monotype shall pay you as a royalty for a particular transaction related to the Deliverables the following amounts:
Fifty percent (50%) of Monotype’s Net Revenues for all Digital Commerce transactions; and
Twenty five percent (25%) of Monotype’s Net Revenues for all transactions other than Digital Commerce transactions.
Monotype will make commercially reasonable efforts to make sales reports available to you within your Account in real-time; however, Monotype will make such sales reports available to you at least within sixty (60) days following the last day of each March, June, September, and December. The report will indicate, at a minimum, the Licensed Font Software distributed by Monotype pursuant to this Agreement and the amount of royalties payable to you as a result. All royalty payments will be paid to you in the manner set forth in your Account on at least a quarterly basis (provided minimum payment thresholds have been met).
Monotype will permit examination of relevant records (to be limited to once per year) by an independent certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to both you and Monotype and whose fee is paid by you under an appropriate Monotype nondisclosure agreement (which shall not prohibit such accountant from testifying or revealing to you or in legal or arbitration proceedings only so much of his or her findings as are necessary for a determination of amounts owed, if any, under this Agreement), at Monotype’s offices and in such a manner as not to interfere with Monotype’s normal business activities. If any amount is not paid when due, Monotype shall promptly pay such amount, along with interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date such payment is due to the date such payment is actually made.
If any amount otherwise payable to you under this Agreement is subject to tax withholding and/or other tax collected at the source by any taxing authority, such tax shall be deducted and paid by Monotype from the amount otherwise payable to you. Monotype shall provide you with a copy of the official receipt covering such payment of tax, if such is available. Monotype shall reasonably cooperate with you in order to obtain the benefit of any applicable tax treaties pertaining to such taxes.
4.    Ownership; Enforcement.

You and Monotype agree that you own the Deliverables and all modifications or enhancements thereto made pursuant to this Agreement, however, Monotype shall have an exclusive license to any modifications or enhancements for the term of this Agreement and you shall have no right to use, distribute or sublicense any such modifications or enhancements to any third party either during or subsequent to the Term of this Agreement.
You consent to Monotype undertaking any actions at its own expense, which, Monotype, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or beneficial for the protection or defense of the intellectual property rights in the Deliverables. Monotype shall have the right, but not the obligation, to finally settle and resolve any and all claims you may have against any person or entity using, copying, distributing, or otherwise exploiting the Deliverables or any component thereof without a license. You agree to provide reasonable assistance to Monotype in furtherance of this Section 4(B) and, upon request from Monotype, will execute a formal authorization letter or other instrument documenting the rights granted to Monotype pursuant to this Agreement.
5.    Your Representations; Indemnification; Disclaimer.

You represent and warrant that you have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement, to and to perform your obligations hereunder.
You represent and warrant that the Deliverables do not infringe patents, copyrights, trademarks, design rights, contract claims, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights of third parties.
You represent and warrant that the Deliverables are not Publicly Available Software or otherwise subject to a Publicly Available Software agreement.

You represent and warrant to Monotype that the Licensed Font Software meets and will meet the functionality and performance standards that are consistent with those of a high-quality font foundry. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of Notice from Monotype of a reproducible error in any Licensed Font Software, you will provide a correction or work around to such error. If you believe that a correction or work around is not technically feasible, you shall immediately provide Notice to Monotype and the Licensed Font Software affected will be deleted from this Agreement, removed from Monotype’s inventory where applicable, and you will reimburse Monotype for all payments which were paid by Monotype for such Licensed Font Software.
